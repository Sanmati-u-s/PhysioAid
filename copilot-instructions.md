Physiotherapy for shoulder pain includes gentle exercises like pendulum swings, doorframe stretches, and arm circles to improve mobility and circulation. Other exercises include wall push-ups to build strength, exercises with a stick for controlled movement, and scapular squeezes to activate the muscles between the shoulder blades. It is important to stay within an acceptable pain level, typically rated 0-5 out of 10, and to adjust the exercises by reducing the range of motion, speed, or repetitions if pain exceeds this level.  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  
Gentle mobility and stretching exercises [2, 8, 9]  

• Pendulum swings: Lean over, letting the affected arm hang down. Gently swing the arm in small circles, forward and backward, or side to side. Increase the diameter as it feels comfortable. [3, 4, 8]  
• Doorframe stretch: Stand in a doorway with your hands on the frame, elbows at a 90-degree angle. Step forward into the doorway to feel a stretch in your chest and shoulder. Hold for 20-30 seconds. [1, 10]  
• Arm circles: Perform small, gentle circles with your arms to warm up the muscles and improve blood flow. Do this in both forward and backward directions. [2, 4]  
• Cross-body stretch: Lie on your side with the affected arm underneath you and bent at a 90-degree angle. Use your unaffected arm to gently push the affected arm down until you feel a stretch in the back of the shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds. [6, 11, 12, 13]  

Strengthening and active exercises [4, 14]  

• Wall push-ups: Stand facing a wall and place your hands on it, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Bend your elbows and lower your body toward the wall, then push back to the starting position. [7, 15, 16, 17]  
• Scapular squeezes: Stand with your arms at your sides, bent at a 90-degree angle with palms facing up. Gently push your forearms outward and squeeze your shoulder blades together. Hold for a second before returning to the start. [6]  
• Stick or broom handle exercises: Hold a stick with both hands. Use the stick to guide your arms to lift up in front or push one arm out to the side. You can also hold it behind your back to lift your arms up and back. [4, 18]  
• Wall slide: Stand facing a wall, with your forearms against it and thumbs pointing away. Keeping your shoulder blades back and together, slowly slide your arms up the wall as far as you can, then lower them back down. [1, 5]  

Important considerations 

• Pain management: Aim to keep any pain experienced during the exercise at a level of 0-5 out of 10. If pain is higher, reduce the range of motion, the speed of the movement, or the number of repetitions. [5]  
• Consistency: Perform these exercises regularly, following the recommended repetitions and sets to see the best results. [6, 7, 15]

Physiotherapy for lower back pain involves a multi-component program of exercises, education, and strength, flexibility, and endurance training to reduce pain, improve mobility, and increase function. Common exercises include pelvic tilts, knee-to-chest stretches, cat-cow, and bridges, which help stabilize the core and stretch muscles. A physiotherapist assesses individual needs to create a personalized plan, and exercises should be performed correctly and consistently for best results.  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Common exercises and stretches 

• Pelvic tilt: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat. Gently tighten your abdominal muscles to pull your lower back up, away from the floor. Hold for five seconds and repeat 5-30 times. [3, 4, 6, 7]  
• Single knee to chest: Lie on your back with knees bent. Pull one knee to your chest, hold for 10-30 seconds, then repeat with the other leg. Aim for 5-10 repetitions on each side. [3, 4, 6]  
• Bridge: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat. Tighten your abdominal and buttock muscles and lift your hips to form a straight line from your knees to your shoulders. Hold for three deep breaths and repeat 5-30 times. [3, 4, 7, 8, 9]  
• Cat-cow stretch: Start on your hands and knees. Slowly arch your back up towards the ceiling, tucking your chin to your chest. Then, slowly let your belly sag toward the floor and look up. Repeat 3-5 times, twice a day. [4, 10, 11, 12, 13]  

Important considerations 

• Assessment: A physiotherapist will assess your specific impairments to design a tailored program, focusing on a multi-component approach. [1]  
• Consistency: Regularly performing the exercises is crucial for maximizing function and getting better faster. [5]  
• Proper technique: Ensure you are performing the exercises correctly. Placing a rolled-up towel under your low back during a pelvic tilt can help verify proper form. [1, 3, 14]  
• Pain management: It is normal to feel some muscle soreness initially, but if an exercise becomes painful, reassess your technique or stop. Don't push through sharp pain. [5, 15]  
• Other activities: Low-impact activities like walking or swimming can also help improve blood circulation and promote healing. [16]

Physiotherapy for knee osteoarthritis includes strengthening, aerobic, and balance exercises to reduce pain and improve function. A physical therapist will create a personalized plan involving exercises you can do at home, like leg lifts and wall sits, and may use manual therapy, ultrasound, or electrical stimulation to manage symptoms. Other helpful strategies include using a cane, wearing a brace, applying heat or cold packs, and trying topical capsaicin or NSAID gels.  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  
Exercise 

• Strengthening: Focus on exercises that build strength in your legs and core, as stronger muscles can help support the knee joint and control pain. Examples include: [1, 3, 5]  
	• Lying knee bends [5]  
	• Static quadriceps (quad) strengthening [5]  
	• Leg raises (lying and supported) [5]  
	• Bridging [5]  
	• Sit to stand exercises [5]  
	• Wall sits [5, 6]  

• Mobility and stretching: Improve flexibility and range of motion. Examples include: [3, 8, 9]  
	• Hamstring stretches [3]  
	• Calf stretches [3]  
	• Heel slides [8]  

• Aerobic exercise: Activities like walking, swimming, or Tai Chi can improve overall fitness and help with metabolism. [2, 10]  
• Balance: Exercises like single-leg stands can improve stability. [5, 11]  

Other treatments 

• Manual therapy: A therapist may use massage or manipulation to help with pain and muscle spasms. [3]  
• Modalities: Ultrasound uses sound waves, while electrical stimulation uses a mild electrical current to treat pain. [3]  
• Heat and cold therapy: Apply heat to relax muscles or cold to reduce soreness after exercise. [3, 7]  
• Braces or shoe inserts: These can support your joint and reduce stress on the knee. [7]  
• Assistive devices: A cane or walker can help take pressure off your knee when walking. [7]  

Important considerations 

• Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your exercises. [1, 10]  
• Warm up for 5-10 minutes before strength training, for example, by using an exercise bike or walking briskly. [1]  
• Focus on good technique to get the most benefit and avoid injury. [12]  
• A physical therapist can help you create a personalized plan that fits your specific needs and goals. [3]

Physical therapy for tennis elbow involves a combination of exercises to strengthen and stretch the forearm, as well as other modalities like ice, massage, and taping. Exercises typically focus on resisted wrist extension, wrist flexion, and forearm rotation (supination), often starting with no weight and progressing to light weights as pain subsides.  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  
Exercises 

• Wrist Extension: Support your forearm on a table with your palm facing down. Use your other hand to lift your wrist upwards as far as possible. Slowly lower your wrist, and repeat. You can add a light weight as you get stronger. [2, 6, 7, 8]  
• Wrist Flexion: With your palm facing up, bend your wrist up toward your body. Slowly lower your wrist back to the starting position. You can add a light weight. [1, 6, 7, 9]  
• Forearm Rotation (Supination/Pronation): Rest your forearm on a table with your elbow bent at $90^\circ$ and your thumb pointing up (palm up). Slowly rotate your forearm so your palm faces down, then slowly rotate it back to the starting position. You can add a light weight. [1, 2, 6, 10]  
• Towel Twist: Hold a towel with both hands and twist it in opposite directions, as if wringing it out. [9]  
• Grip Strengthening: Squeeze a ball or use grippers to build hand and forearm strength. [8]  
• Shoulder Exercises: Strengthening exercises for the shoulder, such as external rotations, are also beneficial. [8]  

Other treatments 

• Ice Therapy: Apply an ice pack for 20 minutes at a time, multiple times a day, to reduce pain and inflammation. [11]  
• Stretching: Gently stretch the forearm muscles by pulling the hand down or up with the opposite hand while keeping the elbow straight. [5]  
• Taping: Kinesio taping can help support the affected area and reduce pain. [3]  
• Massage and Ultrasound: A therapist may use these techniques to help with pain control. [4]  
• Shockwave Therapy: This non-invasive therapy uses sound waves to promote healing and is becoming more common for conditions like tennis elbow. [12, 13]  

Important considerations 

• Consult a doctor: Always consult a doctor before starting any exercise program to ensure it's the right treatment for your condition and to rule out more serious injuries. [9]  
• Listen to your body: Do not push through sharp pain. If pain returns, stop and rest. You may need to modify your activities or rest and apply ice. [9]  
• Progress gradually: Start without any weights and gradually increase repetitions and weight as you are able to complete the exercises without increased pain. [6, 7]  
• Modify activities: A physical therapist can help you identify and modify daily activities that may be causing the pain. [9]
